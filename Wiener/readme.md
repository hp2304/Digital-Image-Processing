# Problem Statement
Try to recover corrupted image using wiener filtering.

## Requirements
* Go through **Motion_blur** assignment first.
* Read slides 37 to 42 in **Restoration.pdf**.

## Procedure and Usage
* Here our input image (call it **g**) is degraded, meaning there will be some noise and some filter applied to original image.
* Applied filter *h* is same as **Motion_blur**, average filter of size 1x21.
* Call fourier transform of image **G** and fourier transform of filter **H**.
* Find out left side of equation shown on slide 41 of *Restoration.pdf*. **K** in that equation is *noise to signal ratio* (**NSR**), it will be taken as input. And we need to tune it to get best result.
* Do *Inverse Fourier Transform* of above computed part to get recovered image back.

```bash
foo@bar:~$ gcc main.c -lm -lpthread -o main
foo@bar:~$ ./main
```
Give **degraded_256_256.raw** as input (256 height and width) (This image is generated by applying 1x21 average filter on cameraman image, and then gaussian noise is added to it). Try out different values of **NSR** ranging from 0 to 1 and visulize the recovered image. Try 0.0167 as NSR value and visulize recovered image.
