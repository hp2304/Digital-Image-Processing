# Problem Statement
Read a .raw image file and store it's histogram in .txt file

## Usage
```bash
foo@bar:~$ gcc a4.c -o a4
foo@bar:~$ ./a4
```

* Basically this program just stores the **histogram** of input image in *img_hist.txt* file. This .txt file can be opened in ImageJ as histogram and visulized. Also this histogram can be saved as image (.png, .jpg, etc) in ImageJ for easiness. Check out sample files...
