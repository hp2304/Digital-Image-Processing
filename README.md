# Digital Image Processing Assignments

## Introduction

- These are the solved assignments for the course digital image processing taught at my university. I took these elective to strengthen my fundamentals in Image Processing and Computer Vision.

- Mostly all assignments are implemented in **C** language as it was a requirement. Input images are **grayscale** and in **RAW** file format. RAW images can be visualized and can be converted to other well known image file formats (and vice versa) using [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html). To visualize the same ImageJ requires image dimensions to decode it correctly. Provided RAW images are named as such to indicate its dimensions, 

    *{filename}\_{width}\_{height}.raw*

- I have also included respective lecture notes in its directory. 

- Optionally, I have done a few exercises in Matlab which weren't part of the assignments. Same is marked with * (asterisk sign) in the **Table of Contents** Section.

## Requirements

- gcc or any C compiler
- [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html)
- Matlab (Optional)
- pthread C library (Optional)
