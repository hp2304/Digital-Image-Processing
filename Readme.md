# Digital Image Processing Assignments
These are the assignments for the course digital image processing taught at my university.

Mostly all the assignments are implemented in **C** language. Basically all these processing stuff is done on **grayscale** images, also all the I/O files are in **raw** file format. These .raw images can be visulized in [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html).

**NOTE**

While giving input to programs, 
* Always use **.raw** file format and it should be **grayscale** image. For this purpose [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) can be very useful. It can convert .png, .jpg, etc images to .raw format and vice versa. It can also display image from raw image files. Can convert *rgb* images to *grayscale* too.
* Pass correct *height* and *width* values for given input file to avoid weird outputs.
* Incorrect filename will result in *segmentation fault*.
* Also I am no expert at following best coding practices (Formatting, commenting and stuff) so bear with me :)
